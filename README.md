<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [AWESOME BOOKS] <a name="about-project"></a>

> This project aims to create a basic website that showcases a list of books that can be edited by users. The objective is to build a responsive multi-page book website using Html, CSS, and JavaScript.

> As part of the project, you will be required to implement the Html-CSS-JavaScript linter following the guidelines in the Html-CSS-JavaScript linter config documentation. Additionally, you should adopt a mobile-first approach in the website design and ensure that it is responsive both on mobile and desktop devices. The website should also be interactive, with functionality for adding and removing books from the list. Finally, you should run tests and deploy the website.


**[AWESOME BOOKS]** The website will consist of three pages: List, Add, and Contact.
